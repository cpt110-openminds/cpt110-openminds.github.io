                <p>We refer to our group as ‘OpenMinds’, and as part of our higher educational pursuits in I.T., we were required to form a group with our fellow students and expand our knowledge within this subject to produce a report documenting our learnings as well as formulating a plan to create an original I.T. project. The purpose of this assignment was to achieve core learning outcomes through: Enabling knowledge, Critical analysis, Problem solving, Communication and Teamwork.</p>
                <p>The mission of ‘OpenMinds’ is to enrich our knowledge, education, and skills within the I.T. industry through active participation, collaboration and analysis, enabling us to achieve our career objectives and thrive within our chosen fields, as individuals and as a team. We believe we have achieved this mission in addition to the core learning outcomes.</p>
