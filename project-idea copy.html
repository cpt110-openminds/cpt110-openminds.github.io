                                <p>With how fast today's technology progresses and language evolves it's hard for anyone to keep up, let alone parents trying to understand the activities their children are engaged in. With mental health in children becoming more and more of a prominent issue, quite often we're missing the signs that could not only prevent adverse mental health issues but also teen suicide. With this in mind we want to create an application that monitors the things occurring on a child's computer and detects warning signs and dangerous behaviours.</p>
                                <p>With children of all ages, mental health complications come from an array of causes. Such causes and problems that children experience; relationship problems (for example family, peers), eating or body-image issues, bullying (including cyberbullying), abuse (physical, emotional or sexual), feeling sad or depressed, worry or anxiety and self-harm or suicide (source; healthdirect). Another abuse that children face is domestic violence, which can alienate them from their classmates and family. When children experience these issues, they are most vulnerable between the ages of 12 and 16 years (source; health direct). With the ages in mind, children really start to engage in the online world well before they are 12. Research conducted by esafety have discovered that 81% of parents with preschoolers say their children use the internet and 94% of the same parents report that their child was using the internet by the age of 4.  Further to that, giant online social companies like Facebook or Instagram are aware of this and try to limit their services to children that are 13 years and older.</p>
                                <p>At this age, social media sites are vital to a child's social and creative life (source; raisingchildren). While these sites can have a great benefit for a child's social life or learning adventures, they also have their drawbacks. One drawback is the unlimited content that they can or already have access to, which can say a lot in their digital footprint. In one instance highlighted by "The Independent" is of a girl named Molly. Molly unfortunately ended her own life at just the age of 14. She was heavily engaged on a social media platform known as Pinterest, and online scrapbook. It was revealed a month after her death that she had a confronting digital footprint. Pinterest sent her email showing her images of self-harm and a quote "I can't tell you how many times I wish I was dead." Here at OpenMinds, we have a project that would monitor the online use of children and develop a digital mental health profile (DMHP) and provide a platform where children could chat to a bot designed specifically for them and relate to them without any fear of judgement. For concerned parents, it can provide peace of mind that their children have another platform to express themselves.</p>
                                <p>The primary function of the application is to cache information and compare it against a database of predetermined warning signs. The secondary function would be a chatbot that activates when certain parameters were met. Machine Learning would be used to help craft algorithms for both parts of the system to fine tune an understanding of the risk factors. The information collected from each computer that has this application installed would be used to further evolve the algorithms or notice changing trends including slang and new websites that become more frequented when a decline in behaviour begins.</p>
                                <p>This application would be designed with child psychologists involved at the start to help determine and understand common language and behaviour amongst children at risk or engaging in dangerous online behaviour. Using a combination of a Naive Bayes algorithm and a Support Vector Machine, the information obtained from the professionals, browsing history of at risk children and any other reputable source would be filtered to create a set of values that would activate part two of the application.</p>
                                <p>Should the parameters for intervention be met, the chat bot, that is the second part of this application would be designed to check on the child by asking a series of questions that wouldn't be simple yes or no questions. I.e." What did you do today?" or "Who is your best friend?" These questions would be designed by the child psychologists once again and would aim at having the child open up to them. The chatbot would more than likely run on the Microsoft Azure platform as it seems to be customisable enough to handle such a complex chatbot. Once the child has finished the bot interaction the bot would once again cross reference with a secondary system looking for a trend and from there it would decide the most appropriate course of action.</p>
                                <p>The courses of action range from making a note to check back with the child about an event, checking in a second time in a few days or where the bot identifies it necessary it may offer to connect the child to external help. Should the app meet a highly stringent set of values it may email the parents with a report that they need to follow up. This application is set up to do a mental health triage and decide the best course of action. It will take a large amount of data to get its values right, however even if it sheds some light on how the behaviours start, it may go a long way to improving the understanding of when the issues actually begin.</p>
                                <p>Some potential drawbacks are definitely making a child interact with a bot and feeling like that bot is impartial. There is also a privacy aspect, children are the specific target of this app as they are the ones at risk and also their parents have legal guardianship. The application is unsuitable to be installed on a person over the age of 18s computer as there are some problematic issues around privacy laws. It would have to be voluntarily installed and a user agreement accepted. The user agreement will have to be written to let parents know that this is not a fix for online behaviours but a tool for helping them to monitor their child. We would not be advertising this application as a one stop shop for policing their child. We believe in a level freedom where browsing history won't be released (unless it's for extreme cases) and private conversations will never be recorded by us.</p>
                                <p>In terms of revenue, we will be taking a non-for-profit approach to this scenario. Here at OpenMinds we want to be engaged and open within all communities and other organisations specialising in mental health. We will be focusing on donations from parents, organisations that believe in our cause and government funding. Another revenue that we would like to expand is to be contracted by the government to conduct seminars at public schools. These seminars will show children, teachers and parents how this project will work and help give everyone a better understanding on their Digital Mental Health Footprint.</p>
                                <p>This application wouldn't solve all of the current issues facing children and their online behaviour, although we would hope we're able to put a severe dent in it using Machine Learning and some guidance from professionals.</p>
