                            <p>Here at OpenMinds, we are dedicated individuals working together to achieve a goal to make an internet experience safer for the most vulnerable of our society, children. With the use of the internet being at our fingertips, content has never been abundant. This easily accessible content is usually quite harmless but rather helpful to an experienced user, which is why we are creating an extension to the most popular web browsers out there, Talk 2 Me (T2M). T2M, is a chat bot. T2M goal is to give children a safe space a place to talk about their lives, good or bad without fear of judgment from any human. T2M will be programmed through the Microsoft Azure platform as it has already the foundation laid out for use to build this platform.</p>
                            <p>As mentioned above, T2M is a chat bot but not just any old chat bot but a chat bot that has the abil-ity use machine learning to build a Digital Mental Health Profile (DMHP). Behind the scenes, as a user is browsing the web, site hoping from site to site, T2M is analysing the content the user is view-ing and comparing the content to red flagged items pre-determined by child psychologists here at OpenMinds. The content that T2M analyses will be from text and images results and will measure how long they viewed said items for, and when did those items lead the user to next. Once a pa-rameter has been by the red flagged items, T2M will automatically active to begin to attempt to have a conversation with user. </p>
