                            <p>Upon embarking on creating this project, the group gathered to plan and discuss the approach deemed necessary for completing this task. Much like with assignment two (2), the group has been working together collectively for several weeks, as such each member has established good rapport and a sound knowledge of the other members’ talents and strengths and what processes works for the group. The group was fortunate in obtaining members with compatible personalities and a shared drive to contribute and produce quality work, thus making for an efficient and productive study environment. The group thrived on the basis of inclusivity, respectful and regular communication, clearly defined roles and equal delegation. As such, the group employed the same methods used in assignment two (2) to create assignment three (3) and five (5). Due to the success experienced in assignment two (2) this approach was deemed appropriate and useful to be applied second time round.</p>
                            <p>The only changes introduced was to utilise ‘Microsoft Teams’ instead of ‘Google Docs’ to deposit individual works and documents. This was chosen in part for comparison sake of similar products; however, the main driver was to utilise additional attributes that ‘Microsoft Teams’ offers which Google Docs does not - specifically GitHub integration and operating as a chat-based workspace. This would enable the group to utilise many of the same universal features that google docs offers but would also allow users to participate in voice and video calls whilst collaborating on shared work. This would eliminate the need to utilise two platforms in the course of communication (Google Docs, & Discord), replacing them with one platform capable of performing both tasks with the aim of increasing productivity. </p>
