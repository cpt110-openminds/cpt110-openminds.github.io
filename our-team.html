                    <p>Hi! I’m Lachlan. I’m 28 years old and living in Sydney, Australia, though I grew up a little further north in Newcastle. I might seem a little bit old to be starting a degree, however this isn’t my first foray into tertiary education. Over the years I’ve completed a fair portion of a Bachelor of Communications, a little bit of a Bachelor of Business, and have a few TAFE-level certificates to top it off.</p>
                    <p>In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my partner and our two cats. We're in the midst of applying for a partner visa for at the moment, so she's not able to leave the country, but once this is all fixed up we’d love to take a trip to the USA and Canada to visit my sister and her family.</p>
                    <p>I found my passion for IT mostly through tinkering and modding games earlier in life. As I've gotten older and have started to deal with large datasets at work in a non-IT environment, the wheels are always turning in my head around how to smarter deal with these datasets. I think this is why I'm drawn toward a desire to develop data-driven cloud and online applications.</p>
                    <p>In terms of my experience, I've got a little bit of this and that, so to speak. Chances are if a language exists I've had at least a cursory look at it. In terms of what I've put the most time and effort into learning, I can definitely name the following three languages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML</li>
                        <li>CSS</li>
                        <li>C# - specifically around .NET Core and Unity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
                    <p>Unfortunately for my team mates at Open Minds, my personal profile results point squarely towards "does not play well with others", despite what my best intentions might be around a particular interaction!</p>
                    <p>My results in the MBTI Test and the Four Tendencies, the results of which I've found to generally be quite accurate to how I am as a person, paint me as someone who has the capability to be quite disruptive if I disagree with logic or logistics behind a decision that's been made.</p>
                    <p>My tendency to critical analyse a situation can be a fantastic asset to any team because I can pick out potentially unforseen or overlooked issues or solutions. However, I need to be mindful to careless listen to and be open to proposed solutions from others rather than jump to a conclusion of an initial gut feel.</p>
