                            <p>Aaron’s Business Analyst ideal job and Sean’s Business Systems Manager career plan are relevant and have a lot of similar elements. Both career job opportunities require Financial Industry qualifications, strong management skills and previous work experience in managerial position, and additionally ability to build and maintain stakeholder relationships. Another similar aspect between Aaron’s and Sean’s job is possession of problem- solving and strong communication skills. However, Aaron would have more direct customer contact, where Sean would work on leadership position in a team environment. What also differentiates both team members are necessity of having technical skills in the IT industry. Aaron is required to have previous Agile/ Scrum software experience. Sean does not necessarily need to possess coding skills, but ability to use of business software as Zendesk, IP Scape or SalesForce would be highly demanded in the Financial Industry. Additionally, possession of strong analytical skills is required for all group members to get the ideal jobs. </p>
                            <p>Similarly, Adrianna’s and Carla’s career plans require Banking and Financial Industry qualifications, time management and excellent communication skills within team environment but more importantly with the clients. However, Adrianna would have a frequent customer contact, where Carla might have a client contact on moderate level. Both ladies are not required to have the coding skills, but experience in usage of Microsoft suite and Xplan or XTools is demanded by employers, as their job roles are designed for the Banking, and Finance industry. Adrianna is required to have finance related customer service and accounting experience. Carla’s Paraplanner job position requires skills such as planning, research, problem-solving skills and high attention to detail, which are much more valued and demanded than for Adrianna’s ideal job as a Business, Rescue and Insolvency Strategist. </p>
                            <p>Lachlan’s Mid- Level .Net Developer and Andrew’s Senior Systems Administrator ideal jobs in IT industry have many common elements. Their advanced critical thinking, problem-solving, coding and language skills are highly demanded by employers. Both team members are required to possess great communication and effective collaborative team skills. However, Lachlan’s job position put a focus on project management experience, where Andrew’s job requires more troubleshooting, server hardware and software technology knowledge and strong technical documentation skills. What differentiates Andrew and Lachlan from the other members of this group is that they are not required to have a Financial Industry experience, as their career plans are designed for the IT industry. </p>
