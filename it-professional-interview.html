    <p>The 'Information Technology' industry as a whole is an extensive and a highly dynamic field with a multidimensional expanse that reaches directly, and indirectly into different aspects of societies and people's daily lives - constantly changing and evolving the way in which civilisations function. As such, the I.T. industry is one of the most robust in the world offering vast opportunities for I.T. technicians and professionals of all kinds to pursue a career in a multitude of forms within the industry itself, therefore making it an attractive vocation for many, particularly in the developed world. However, as appealing and exciting as the I.T. industry may be, and can be an overwhelming and misleading task trying to determine where to start for applicants' new to the field. To help resolve this, we endeavoured to seek out and interview an experienced I.T. professional to gain better insight into the daily workings, encounters and career progression of an industry professional.</p>

Having had several roles over the course of his career, Peter has developed an extensive range of skills as a: Quality, Audit and Risk Manager, Teacher and Coordinator, National Customer Service Manager and Technical Services Manager, as well as an Electronics and Senior Technician. Peter has developed and obtained these titles and skills through his employment with multiple TAFE Institutes, several electronics companies, in addition to multinational conglomerates for I.T. communications systems and defense equipment, and the Royal Australian Navy to name a few.</p>
